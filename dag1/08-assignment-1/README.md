# Assignment 1

You now know everything is takes to build a basic website. So let's try this!
Create a file called index.html (actually the name doesn't matter), as well as
as styles.css.

Remember all the stuff with <html>, <body> etc? Well this is not school, so
just copy/paste all of that from one of the other folders. In programming,
copying is encouraged!

Next, you're going to create a page for your favorite artist. It should contain:
* Name
* Short bio (Wikipedia is your friend)
* 3 pictures
* 3 songs (link them to Youtube videos)

You can play around with the layout of the page (see flexbox and grid) in earlier
exercises. Use colors, background colors, and font-sizes to make it your own.

Remember, copying and stealing is allowed and encouraged!
